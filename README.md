## Usage

Once installed, the extension provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and other features when editing CWScript files.

### Syntax Highlighting

The extension provides syntax highlighting for CWScript files. Keywords, constants, and function names are highlighted with different colors to make them stand out from the rest of the code. Comments are also highlighted with a different color.

### Code Snippets

The extension provides code snippets for common CWScript code patterns. To use a code snippet, type the snippet keyword and press `Tab`. The code snippet will be inserted into the editor.

### Code Completion

The extension provides code completion for keywords, constants, and function names. As you type code in the editor, the extension will suggest keywords, constants, and function names that match what you're typing. You can accept a suggestion by pressing `Enter`.

### Parameter Hints

The extension provides parameter hints for function calls. As you type a function call in the editor, the extension will display a tooltip with the function's parameters and their types. This can help you remember the correct order of parameters and their types.

### Hover Information

The extension provides hover information for keywords, constants, and function names. If you hover over a keyword, constant, or function name in the editor, the extension will display a tooltip with information about what the keyword, constant, or function does.
